# Pomodoro-Application
The project's main purpose is time management, based on the Pomodoro Technique. With a simple interface, the app contains all necessary features, including the timer, Start, Stop, and Reset Buttons, which allow users to track their workflow.

## Features
- Can be minimized
- When the timer hits zero the Program Window pops up.
- A bell sounds when the timer hits 0.
- Tracks how many work sessions have been completed.
- Option to pause the timer to replicate real work scenarios.
- Reset the Button to start another work session.
- Simple UI using Tkinter

## Running The Program
You should run the "Pomodoro Application.exe" which will download all the Files needed to run the program and does not require Python to be installed on the system.
If you want to install the Program Individually and run the main.exe, You should have the following installed:
- main.py file
- tomato.png
- Python 3.12
- Tkinter Library
- Math Library
Both Tkinter and Math come pre-installed if you have Python 3.12 or later.
main.py and tomato.png files should be in the same directory as the main.exe program, you don't need to download individual files if you download the
program using the Pomodoro Application.exe
#### NOTE:
- Pomodoro Application.exe is an installer program that installs all the necessary files along with the Application main.exe
- main.exe is the file to be run after the installation has been completed.
