# Pomodoro-Application
The project's main purpose is time management, based on the Pomodoro Technique. With a simple interface, the app contains all necessary features, including the timer, Start, Stop, and Reset Buttons, which allow users to track their workflow.

## Features
- Can be minimized
- When the timer hits zero the Program Window pops up.
- A bell sounds when the timer hits 0.
- Tracks how many work sessions have been completed.
- Option to pause the timer to replicate real work scenarios.
- Reset the Button to start another work session.
- Simple UI using Tkinter

## Getting Started
You should run the "Pomodoro Application.exe" which will download all the Files needed to run the program and does not require Python to be installed on the system.
If you want to run the Program Individually using the main.py, You should have the following installed:
- Python 3.12
- Tkinter Library
- Math Library
*Both Tkinter and Math come pre-installed if you have Python 3.12 or later.

## Installation
Download and Run the "Pomodoro Application.exe" file and download it just as you download any other program. Follow the SetUp wizard and on-screen instructions.

A simpler version of the Project was assigned by Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp course on Udemy. I took it a step further by adding some key features.
